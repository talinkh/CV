<h3>About Me ✨</h3>
<p>Hello! <br> I am Talin Khijo. I was born on March 3rd 2001 in Aleppo, Syria, and moved to Switzerland in 2016 as a refugee. However, this experience did not stop me from chasing my dreams and hoping for a better future!</p>

<p>My passion for technology ignited during the last year of high school when I heard a presentation by some programmers who came to our school to give us a little insight into programming. Although my initial plan was not to study informatics, since I had zero knowledge in this field, I am now so happy that I ended up choosing this faculty for my university studies.</p>

<p>Currently, I am a student at USI, where I am diving deep into my studies while looking for job opportunities that will allow me to apply what I am learning.</p>

<p>My goal is to find a position where I can learn from experienced professionals and collaborate with like-minded individuals. I am ready to tackle challenges and grow within the tech community. I am excited about the journey ahead and the chance to build a career that aligns with my passions!</p>
